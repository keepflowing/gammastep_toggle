# gammastep_toggle
A simple shell script for toggling gammastep on or off. (-O mode)

By default I use 2600K as my temperature during the day, but you can easily change that by setting the value to whatever you want in the script.

I recommend binding this script to a shortcut in your DE. I use SUPER + G to toggle on or off.
